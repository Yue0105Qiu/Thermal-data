This is a Matlab package to compare thermodynamic data from different sources. 

It will give the plot as well as calculated data of Cp/R, H/RT, and S/R, depending on your choices.

The result cell for each calculated parameter (Cp/R, H/RT, or S/R) contians two cells. One is source data: x_var[K] y_var[Cp, H, S] y_diff[relative ratio]; the other is the calcualted minmum and maximum relative ratio between different sources, marked together with the corresponding temperature point.
See some plot demo below:

Enjoy!
